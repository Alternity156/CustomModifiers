# CustomModifiers
 Mod that allows changing values for some of the modifiers

Allows you to change the values of some of the modifiers (Tempo Ramp max speed, Aim Assist, Target Speed, Extra Particle scale amount, Psychedelia phase speed and song speed)
To use, boot the game once, close it, then in Audica\UserData\ModsPref.ini change the values to your liking. When activating modifiers they will now use these values instead of the original ones. Tempo Ramp cannot be set under 1.0, no cap for how fast. Aim Assist cannot be set under 0.0 and over 1.0. Song Speed cannot be set under 1.0. Everything else is uncapped.

Please note that if you use this and the Particle Killer mod, you might not get the wanted result when using Extra Particles.
